# feito

feito is a simple to-do list built with HTML, CSS/Sass and Vanilla Javascript.

## Description

feito is one of my first beginner projects and heavily inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ) of Simo Edwin. I try to recreate as little as possible from the video and implement as much as possible independently or by researching particular things.

[feito.me](https://www.feito.me/) is hosted on Netlify.

## Roadmap

At the time of writing, feito is just a simple to-do list app. In fact, it's just a list app with rudimentary functionality. I'm working on making feito more comprehensive and first of all actually usable.
