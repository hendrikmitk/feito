## Inspirations

-   **[Beginner Vanilla Javascript Project Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ)** - This project is heavily inspired by this video of Simo Edwin. I tried to recreate as little as possible from the video and implement as much as possible independently or by researching particular things.

## Dependencies

-   **[parcel-bundler](https://parceljs.org)** - Blazing fast application bundler which requires zero configuration
-   **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)** - CSS pre-processor that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets
